Now that we know our way around the basic rendering API, let's start with something simple: drawing a line. We'll start by creating a function for it in our `Renderer` class, we'll call it `drawLine`.

Lines go from point A to point B, so we'll need to pass both. We can use `Vec2` for that. We'll also add a parameter for the color we want our line to be. Finally, since these are screen coordinates, we'll round them to the nearest pixel before doing anything with them:

<CodeBlock title="renderer/Renderer.ts">
```typescript
private drawLine(start: Vec2, end: Vec2, color: number) {
  const x0 = ~~(start.x);
  const x1 = ~~(end.x);
  const y0 = ~~(start.y);
  const y1 = ~~(end.y);

  ...
}
```
</CodeBlock>

Next, we need to figure out exactly which points make up the line from start to end. This is easy enough to do with a pen and a piece of grid paper: just draw a line from A to B, and fill in any squares the line crosses over.

<PictureFrame noborder>![A line drawn on grid paper](/img/02-lines/fig1-line.png)</PictureFrame>

The tricky part will be telling a computer how to do this, and that's what we'll learn now. Feel free to try finding a solution yourself before you keep reading.

## Defining a line

Any line can be defined by a linear function $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope, or the change in $y$ when $x$ increases by one. We already have the $x$ and $y$ values of the starting and ending points, so if we can figure out the slope we'll be able to interpolate $y$ for any $x$ value in between. Getting the slope of a linear function from two points is simple, as it's just the change in $y$ over a unit of $x$:

$$
m = \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y_1 - y_0}{x_1 - x_0}
$$

Now we have that, we can figure out $y$ for every value of $x$ between start and end:

<CodeBlock>
```typescript
...

const dx = x1 - x0;
const dy = y1 - y0;
const m = dy / dx;

let y = y0;
for (let x = x0; x <= x1; x++) {
  this.surface.setPixel(x, y, color);
  y += m;
}
```
</CodeBlock>

This almost works, but we need $y$ to be an integer number. Instead of adding to it on every iteration, we can keep track of the *error*, or distance from the actual $y$, and increment by one if it's greater than 0.5:

<CodeBlock>
```typescript
...

const dx = x1 - x0;
const dy = y1 - y0;
const m = dy / dx;

let y = y0;
let error = 0;
for (let x = x0; x <= x1; x++) {
  this.surface.setPixel(x, y, color);
  error += m;
  if (error > 0.5) {
    y++;
    error--;
  }
}
```
</CodeBlock>

We can try this out right now. Let's add some code to our `render()` function:

<CodeBlock title="renderer/Renderer.ts">
```typescript
public render() {
  this.drawLine({ x: 100, y: 100 }, { x: 400, y: 300 }, 0xFF0000FF);
  this.drawLine({ x: 100, y: 100 }, { x: 400, y: 200 }, 0xFF00FF00);
  this.drawLine({ x: 100, y: 100 }, { x: 400, y: 100 }, 0xFFFF0000);
}
```

<div slot="result">![Three colored lines on a black screen](/img/02-lines/lines-1.png)</div>
</CodeBlock>

It works! We can give the function two points, and it will figure out the rest for us.

## Bresenham's algorithm

The solution we've come up with is actually quite similar to a well known line plotting algorithm, [Bresenham's line algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham's_line_algorithm), developed way back in the 1960s and still in use today. The actual Bresenham's algorithm is a little different, as it is optimized to use only integer math which was much faster at the time. Here's a TypeScript implementation of Bresenham's algorithm:

<CodeBlock>
```typescript
...

const dx = x1 - x0;
const dy = y1 - y0;
let D = (2 * dy) - dx;

let y = y0;
for (let x = x0; x <= x1; x++) {
  this.surface.setPixel(x, y, color);
  if (D > 0) {
    y++;
    D += 2 * (dy - dx);
  } else {
    D += 2 * dy;
  }
}
```
</CodeBlock>

The changes can seem rather arbitrary, but the two functions are doing the exact same thing. You don't need to understand all of the math behind it, but if you're interested (and not afraid of a little math), check out the explanation below.

<Details emoji="🤿" title="Deep dive: Bresenham's line algorithm">
  Bresenham's algorithm works with a slightly different definition of a line than we've been using. The starting point is the same:

  $$
  y = f(x) = mx + b
  $$

  We can rewrite this to have all variables on one side:

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  y &= \frac{dy}{dx}x + b\\
  \\
  (dx)y &= (dy)x + (dx)b\\
  \\
  0 &= (dy)x - (dx)y + (dx)b
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  This equation can then be interpreted as a function that takes both $x$ and $y$ as parameters. We also know the value of $b$, so we can replace that now:

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  f(x, y) &= (dy)x + (-dx)y + (dx)b\\
  \\
  &= (dy)x + (-dx)y + y_0x_1 - x_0y_1
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  Now we have our line defined in terms of a function that takes $x$ and $y$: the point is in the line only if $f(x, y) = 0$.

  Then, knowing that for a given point $f(x, y) = 0$ (meaning the point is in the line) and $x \neq x_1$, we need to find out whether the next $y$ should increase or not. We can do that by checking the midpoint between $y$ and $y + 1$:

  $$
  f\left(x + 1, y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
  $$

  Because $f(x,y)$ decreases as $y$ increases, we know that if the result is positive, we have to increase $y$ to get closer to 0, thus $f(x + 1, y + 1) = 0$, and if it's negative, the opposite is true and $f(x + 1, y) = 0$.

  Implementing it this way we end up with the following code:

  <CodeBlock>
  ```typescript
  ...

  const dx = x1 - x0;
  const dy = y1 - y0;
  const f = (x, y) => dy * (x + 1) - dx * (y + 0.5) + y0 * x1 - x0 * y1;

  let y = y0;
  for (let x = x0; x <= x1; x++) {
    this.surface.setPixel(x, y, color);
    if (f(x, y) > 0) {
      y++;
    }
  }
  ```
  </CodeBlock>

  This looks very similar to the actual implementation, but it's not quite there yet. Bresenham's algorithm does one further optimization: using the difference between points rather than evaluating midpoints. This allows it to run using only integer math, which isn't too relevant today as computers are very good at floating point math but was crucial back in the 1960s when the algorithm was developed.

  Let's take that last step. We'll define the difference as follows:

  $$
  D(x, y) = f\left(x + 1, y + \frac{1}{2}\right) - f(x, y)
  $$

  Since $f(x_0, y_0) = 0$, this starts the same as the midpoint method. We can simplify the expression _a lot_. To make it shorter, let's define $C = y_0x_1 - x_0y_1$:

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  D &= D(x_0, y_0) = f\left(x_0 + 1, y_0 + \frac{1}{2}\right) - f(x_0, y_0)\\
  \\
  &= (dy)(x_0 + 1) + (-dx)\left(y_0 + \frac{1}{2}\right) + C - ((dy)x_0 + (-dx)y_0 + C)\\
  \\
  &= (dy)(x_0 + 1) + (-dx)\left(y_0 + \frac{1}{2}\right) - (dy)x_0 - (-dx)y_0\\
  \\
  &= (dy)x_0 + dy + (-dx)y_0 - \frac{1}{2}dx - (dy)x_0 - (-dx)y_0\\
  \\
  &= dy - \frac{1}{2}dx
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  As you can see, most of the terms cancel out and we end up with only $dy - \frac{1}{2}dx$. Like the midpoint method, we choose $(x_0 + 1, y_0 + 1)$ if $D$ is positive and $(x_0 + 1, y_0)$ if it is negative. All that's left is to figure out how the difference changes when we choose the next point, and accumulate that difference over each point.

  If $(x_0 + 1, y_0)$ is chosen, then

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  \Delta D &= f\left(x_0 + 2, y_0 + \frac{1}{2}\right) - f\left(x_0 + 1, y_0 + \frac{1}{2}\right)\\
  \\
  &= (dy)(x_0 + 2) + (-dx)\left(y_0 + \frac{1}{2}\right) - (dy)(x_0 + 1) - (-dx)\left(y_0 + \frac{1}{2}\right)\\
  \\
  &= dy
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  And if $(x_0 + 1, y_0 + 1)$ is chosen, then

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  \Delta D &= f\left(x_0 + 2, y_0 + \frac{3}{2}\right) - f\left(x_0 + 1, y_0 + \frac{1}{2}\right)\\
  \\
  &= (dy)(x_0 + 2) + (-dx)\left(y_0 + \frac{3}{2}\right) - (dy)(x_0 + 1) - (-dx)\left(y_0 + \frac{1}{2}\right)\\
  \\
  &= dy - dx
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  If we implement all of this, we get the following code:

  <CodeBlock>
  ```typescript
  ...

  const dx = x1 - x0;
  const dy = y1 - y0;
  let D = dy - (dx * 0.5);

  let y = y0;
  for (let x = x0; x <= x1; x++) {
    this.surface.setPixel(x, y, color);
    if (D > 0) {
      y++;
      D += dy - dx;
    } else {
      D += dy;
    }
  }
  ```
  </CodeBlock>

  Almost Bresenham's algorithm. To make it work with only integer arithmetic, we need to get rid of that pesky $\frac{1}{2}$. Luckily, since we only care about the *sign* of the accumulated difference, we can multiply everything by 2 without consequence:

  <CodeBlock>
  ```typescript
  ...

  const dx = x1 - x0;
  const dy = y1 - y0;
  let D = (2 * dy) - dx;

  let y = y0;
  for (let x = x0; x <= x1; x++) {
    this.surface.setPixel(x, y, color);
    if (D > 0) {
      y++;
      D += 2 * (dy - dx);
    } else {
      D += 2 * dy;
    }
  }
  ```
  </CodeBlock>

  And that's it! We've arrived at the exact same code we presented before. Hopefully now you have a better understanding of why this code is written as it is.
</Details>

## Extending the algorithm

We've finally reached a functional solution, but it's not quite there yet. In its current form, the algorithm is very limited. You may have noticed the problems by now:

- It doesn't work for negative slopes
- It needs the line to be drawn left to right, otherwise it won't work
- It can't deal with slopes greater than 1 (more vertical lines)

We can make it do all those things by handling the case with negative error, swapping the points around if they're in the wrong order and adding a variant for large slopes.

<Callout emoji="🌶️">
  **Code challenge:** try to extend Bresenham's algorithm with all those things so that it can handle every case. Hint: be careful with vertical lines!
</Callout>

Instead, we're going to use a different solution: a generalized version of Bresenham's algorithm that works with any two points.

<CodeBlock>
```typescript
...

const dx = Math.abs(x1 - x0);
const sx = Math.sign(x1 - x0);
const dy = -Math.abs(y1 - y0);
const sy = Math.sign(y1 - y0);
let error = dx + dy;

let x = x0;
let y = y0;
for (;;) { // Loop until break
  this.surface.setPixel(x, y, color);
  if (x === x1 && y === y1) break;

  const e2 = 2 * error;
  if (e2 >= dy) {
    if (x0 === x1) break;
    error += dy;
    x += sx;
  }
  if (e2 <= dx) {
    if (y0 === y1) break;
    error += dx;
    y += sy;
  }
}
```
</CodeBlock>

This version does away with iterating over a "master" axis, and instead accumulates error over both axes. It also stores the sign separate from the distances, so it works in every direction. For a more detailed explanation of this algorithm, read on below.

<Details emoji="🤿" title="Deep dive: Generalized Bresenham's algorithm">
  For the algorithm to work in all directions, we need to use absolute values for $dx$ and $dy$. We'll keep track of the sign as well, so we know which way to move towards the end point $(x_1, y_1)$.

  $$
  dx = |x_1 - x_0|\\
  dy = |y_1 - y_0|\\
  s_x = sign(x_1 - x_0)\\
  s_y = sign(y_1 - y_0)\\
  $$

  First, we start by drawing $(x_0, y_0)$. This point is always in the line, so the start is the same as always. Next, there's three things that can happen:

  - We need to move horizontally towards $x_1$. In this case, the next point is $(x_0 + s_x, y_0)$.
  - We need to move vertically towards $y_1$. In this case, the next point is $(x_0, y_0 + s_y)$.
  - Both of the above are true, and the next point is $(x_0 + s_x, y_0 + s_y)$.

  This will repeat for any given point in the line, so all that's left is to decide which path we should take at each point. For that, we'll accumulate the error $E$ over both the $x$ and $y$ axes. We'll start from another form of the line equation $y = mx + b$:

  $$
  0 = dx(y - y_0) - dy(x - x_0)
  $$

  That gives us the error as a function of $(x, y)$ such that $E_{xy} = 0$ for each point in the line:

  $$
  E_{xy} = dx(y - y_0) - dy(x - x_0)
  $$

  and we can derive the error for the first step

  $$
  E = dx(y_0 + 1 - y_0) - dy(x_0 + 1 - x_0)
  E = dx - dy
  $$

  Notice how this gives us information about the slope of our line. Because $dx$ and $dy$ are positive numbers, we can affirm

  $$
  E \in [-dy, dx]\\
  E < 0 \iff dx < dy\\
  E > 0 \iff dx > dy\\
  E = 0 \iff dx = dy
  $$

  Then, we can conclude that:

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  E > \frac{-dy}{2} &\iff dx > \frac{dy}{2}\\
  &\iff 1 > \frac{dy}{2dx}\\
  &\iff 2 > \frac{dy}{dx} = m\\
  &\iff m < 2
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  and

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  E < \frac{dx}{2} &\iff dy > \frac{dx}{2}\\
  &\iff \frac{dy}{dx} = m > \frac{1}{2}\\
  &\iff m > \frac{1}{2}
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  This is great, because it helps us decide which pixel we should draw next. We only have three options:

  - $(x_0 + s_x, y_0)$, which follows a slope of $m = 0$
  - $(x_0 + s_x, y_0 + s_y)$, which follows a slope of $m = 1$
  - $(x_0, y_0 + s_y)$, which follows a slope of $m = \infty$

  We want to pick the option that brings the average $m$ closest to the actual slope of our line. Then:

  - If $m \leq \frac{1}{2}$, the slope is closest to $0$ and we advance along the $x$ axis.
  - If $m \geq 2$, the slope is closest to $\infty$ and we advance along the $y$ axis.
  - If $\frac{1}{2} < m < 2$, the slope is closest to $1$ and we advance along both axes.

  We can simplify this decision into two cases: if $m < 2$, we have to advance along $x$, and if $m > \frac{1}{2}$ we advance along $y$. These conditions aren't mutually exclusive, so if both are true we'll move along both axes. This can be easier to understand visually:

  <PictureFrame noborder>![Graph showing slope](/img/02-lines/fig2-graph.png)</PictureFrame>

  The diagram only covers positive values since $dx$ and $dy$ are always positive, but remember the line can be going in any direction depending on the values of $s_x$ and $s_y$.

  Now we only need to find the change in $E$ for the next point. We can easily find this out:

  $$
  E_{x + 1, y} = dx(y - y_0) - dy(x + 1 - x_0) = E_{xy} - dy\\
  E_{x, y + 1} = dx(y + 1 - y_0) - dy(x - x_0) = E_{xy} + dx\\
  E_{x + 1, y + 1} = dx(y + 1 - y_0) - dy(x + 1 - x_0) = E_{xy} + dx - dy
  $$

  Then, we only need to add $dx$ when we move on the $y$ axis and subtract $dy$ when me move on the $x$ axis. All that's left is to add break conditions when we get to the last point. The final code, once again, multiplies everything by two to avoid the $\frac{1}{2}$ term:

  <CodeBlock>
  ```typescript
  ...

  const dx = Math.abs(x1 - x0);
  const sx = Math.sign(x1 - x0);
  const dy = -Math.abs(y1 - y0);
  const sy = Math.sign(y1 - y0);
  let error = dx + dy;

  let x = x0;
  let y = y0;
  for (;;) { // Loop until break
    this.surface.setPixel(x, y, color);
    if (x === x1 && y === y1) break;

    const e2 = 2 * error;
    if (e2 >= dy) {
      if (x0 === x1) break;
      error += dy;
      x += sx;
    }
    if (e2 <= dx) {
      if (y0 === y1) break;
      error += dx;
      y += sy;
    }
  }
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
</Details>
  
Let's try it out. We'll write some code in our `render()` function to draw lines in every direction by rotating them over time. The function can take an `elapsed` parameter, which indicates the number of milliseconds passed since the first frame, so let's use that:

<CodeBlock title="renderer/Renderer.ts">
```typescript
public render(elapsed: number) {
  const {width, height} = this.options;
  const angle = elapsed / 1000;
  const middle = { x: width / 2, y: height / 2 };
  const end = {
    x: Math.cos(angle) * 200 + middle.x,
    y: Math.sin(angle) * 200 + middle.y,
  };

  this.drawLine(middle, end, 0xFFFFFFFF);
}
```

<div slot="result">
  <video autoplay muted loop src="/img/02-lines/line-spinning.webm" />
</div>
</CodeBlock>

And that's it! It took some work, but we can now draw lines between any two points in our canvas.

In the next lesson, we'll use the line drawing function for something a little more exciting: we'll be drawing our first three-dimensional objects.
