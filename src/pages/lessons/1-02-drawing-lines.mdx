Now that we know our way around the basic rendering API, let's start with something simple: drawing a line. We'll start by creating a function for it in our `Renderer` class, we'll call it `drawLine`.

Lines go from point A to point B, so we'll need to pass both. We can use `Vec2` for that. We'll also add a parameter for the color we want our line to be. Finally, since these are screen coordinates, we'll round them to the nearest pixel before doing anything with them:

<CodeBlock title="renderer.ts">
```typescript
private drawLine(start: Vec2, end: Vec2, { r, g, b, a = 1 }: Color) {
  const x0 = ~~(start.x);
  const x1 = ~~(end.x);
  const y0 = ~~(start.y);
  const y1 = ~~(end.y);

  ...
}
```
</CodeBlock>

Next, we need to figure out exactly which points make up the line from start to end. Feel free to try finding a solution yourself before you keep reading.

## Defining a line

Any line can be defined by a linear function $y = mx + b$, where `m` is the slope, or how much `y` changes when `x` increases by one. We already have the `x` and `y` values of the starting and ending points, so if we can figure out the slope we'll be able to interpolate `y` for any `x` value in between. Getting the slope of a linear function from two points is simple, as it's just the change in `y` over a unit of `x`:

$$
m = \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y_1 - y_0}{x_1 - x_0}
$$

Now we have that, we can figure out `y` for every value of `x` between start and end:

<CodeBlock>
```typescript
...

const dx = x1 - x0;
const dy = y1 - y0;
const m = dy / dx;

let y = y0;
for (let x = x0; x <= x1; x++) {
  this.surface.setPixel(x, y, { r, g, b, a });
  y += m;
}
```
</CodeBlock>

This almost works, but we need `y` to be an integer number. Instead of adding to it on every iteration, we can keep track of the *error*, or distance from the actual `y`, and increment by one if it's greater than 0.5:

<CodeBlock>
```typescript
...

const dx = x1 - x0;
const dy = y1 - y0;
const m = dy / dx;

let y = y0;
let error = 0;
for (let x = x0; x <= x1; x++) {
  this.surface.setPixel(x, y, { r, g, b, a });
  error += m;
  if (error > 0.5) {
    y++;
    error--;
  }
}
```
</CodeBlock>

## Bresenham's algorithm

The solution we've come up with is actually quite similar to a well known line plotting algorithm, [Bresenham's line algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham's_line_algorithm), developed way back in the 1960s and still in use today. The actual Bresenham's algorithm is a little different, as it is optimized to use only integer math which was much faster at the time. Here's a TypeScript implementation of Bresenham's algorithm:

<CodeBlock>
```typescript
...

const dx = x1 - x0;
const dy = y1 - y0;
let D = (2 * dy) - dx;

let y = y0;
for (let x = x0; x <= x1; x++) {
  this.surface.setPixel(x, y, { r, g, b, a });
  if (D > 0) {
    y++;
    D += 2 * (dy - dx);
  } else {
    D += 2 * dy;
  }
}
```
</CodeBlock>

The changes can seem rather arbitrary, but the two functions are mathematically equivalent. You don't need to understand all of the math behind it, but if you're interested (and not afraid of a little math), check out the explanation below.

<Details emoji="🤿" title="Deep dive: Bresenham's line algorithm">
  Bresenham's algorithm works with a slightly different definition of a line than we've been using. The starting point is the same:

  $$
  y = f(x) = mx + b
  $$

  We can rewrite this to have all variables on one side:

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  y &= \frac{dy}{dx}x + b\\
  \\
  (dx)y &= (dy)x + (dx)b\\
  \\
  0 &= (dy)x - (dx)y + (dx)b
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  This equation can then be interpreted as a function that takes both `x` and `y` as parameters. We also know the value of `b`, so we can replace that now:

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  f(x, y) &= (dy)x + (-dx)y + (dx)b\\
  \\
  &= (dy)x + (-dx)y + y_0x_1 - x_0y_1
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  Now we have our line defined in terms of a function that takes `x` and `y`: the point is in the line only if $f(x, y) = 0$.

  Then, knowing that for a given point $f(x, y) = 0$ (meaning the point is in the line) and $x \neq x_1$, we need to find out whether the next `y` should increase or not. We can do that by checking the midpoint between `y` and `y + 1`:

  $$
  f(x + 1, y + \frac{1}{2})
  $$

  Because $f(x,y)$ decreases as `y` increases, we know that if the result is positive, we have to increase 'y' to get closer to 0, thus $f(x + 1, y + 1) = 0$, and if it's negative, the opposite is true and $f(x + 1, y) = 0$.

  Implementing it this way we end up with the following code:

  <CodeBlock>
  ```typescript
  ...

  const dx = x1 - x0;
  const dy = y1 - y0;
  const f = (x, y) => dy * (x + 1) - dx * (y + 0.5) + y0 * x1 - x0 * y1;

  let y = y0;
  for (let x = x0; x <= x1; x++) {
    this.surface.setPixel(x, y, { r, g, b, a });
    if (f(x, y) > 0) {
      y++;
    }
  }
  ```
  </CodeBlock>

  This looks very similar to the actual implementation, but it's not quite there yet. Bresenham's algorithm does one further optimization: using the difference between points rather than evaluating midpoints. This allows it to run using only integer math, which isn't too relevant today as computers are very good at floating point math but was crucial back in the 1960s when the algorithm was developed.

  Let's take that last step. We'll define the difference as follows:

  $$
  D(x, y) = f(x + 1, y + \frac{1}{2}) - f(x, y)
  $$

  Since $f(x_0, y_0) = 0$, this starts the same as the midpoint method. We can simplify the expression _a lot_. To make it shorter, let's define $C = y_0x_1 - x_0y_1$:

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  D &= D(x_0, y_0) = f(x_0 + 1, y_0 + \frac{1}{2}) - f(x_0, y_0)\\
  \\
  &= (dy)(x_0 + 1) + (-dx)(y_0 + \frac{1}{2}) + C - ((dy)x_0 + (-dx)y_0 + C)\\
  \\
  &= (dy)(x_0 + 1) + (-dx)(y_0 + \frac{1}{2}) - (dy)x_0 - (-dx)y_0\\
  \\
  &= (dy)x_0 + dy + (-dx)y_0 - \frac{1}{2}dx - (dy)x_0 - (-dx)y_0\\
  \\
  &= dy - \frac{1}{2}dx
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  As you can see, most of the terms cancel out and we end up with only $dy - \frac{1}{2}dx$. Like the midpoint method, we choose $(x_0 + 1, y_0 + 1)$ if $D$ is positive and $(x_0 + 1, y_0)$ if it is negative. All that's left is to figure out how the difference changes when we choose the next point, and accumulate that difference over each point.

  If $(x_0 + 1, y_0)$ is chosen, then

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  \Delta D &= f(x_0 + 2, y_0 + \frac{1}{2}) - f(x_0 + 1, y_0 + \frac{1}{2})\\
  \\
  &= (dy)(x_0 + 2) + (-dx)(y_0 + \frac{1}{2}) - (dy)(x_0 + 1) - (-dx)(y_0 + \frac{1}{2})\\
  \\
  &= dy
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  And if $(x_0 + 1, y_0 + 1)$ is chosen, then

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  \Delta D &= f(x_0 + 2, y_0 + \frac{3}{2}) - f(x_0 + 1, y_0 + \frac{1}{2})\\
  \\
  &= (dy)(x_0 + 2) + (-dx)(y_0 + \frac{3}{2}) - (dy)(x_0 + 1) - (-dx)(y_0 + \frac{1}{2})\\
  \\
  &= dy - dx
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  If we implement all of this, we get the following code:

  <CodeBlock>
  ```typescript
  ...

  const dx = x1 - x0;
  const dy = y1 - y0;
  let D = dy - (dx * 0.5);

  let y = y0;
  for (let x = x0; x <= x1; x++) {
    this.surface.setPixel(x, y, { r, g, b, a });
    if (D > 0) {
      y++;
      D += dy - dx;
    } else {
      D += dy;
    }
  }
  ```
  </CodeBlock>

  Almost Bresenham's algorithm. To make it work with only integer arithmetic, we need to get rid of that pesky $\frac{1}{2}$. Luckily, since we only care about the *sign* of the accumulated difference, we can multiply everything by 2 without consequence:

  <CodeBlock>
  ```typescript
  ...

  const dx = x1 - x0;
  const dy = y1 - y0;
  let D = (2 * dy) - dx;

  let y = y0;
  for (let x = x0; x <= x1; x++) {
    this.surface.setPixel(x, y, { r, g, b, a });
    if (D > 0) {
      y++;
      D += 2 * (dy - dx);
    } else {
      D += 2 * dy;
    }
  }
  ```
  </CodeBlock>

  And that's it! We've arrived at the exact same code we presented before. Hopefully now you have a better understanding of why this code is written as it is.
</Details>

We can try this out right now. Let's add some code to our `render()` function:

<CodeBlock title="renderer.ts">
```typescript
public render() {
  this.drawLine({ x: 100, y: 100 }, { x: 400, y: 300 }, { r: 1, g: 0, b: 0 });
  this.drawLine({ x: 100, y: 100 }, { x: 400, y: 200 }, { r: 0, g: 1, b: 0 });
  this.drawLine({ x: 100, y: 100 }, { x: 400, y: 100 }, { r: 0, g: 0, b: 1 });
}
```

<div slot="result">![Three colored lines on a black screen](/img/02-lines/lines-1.png)</div>
</CodeBlock>



## Extending the algorithm

We've finally reached a functional solution, but it's not quite there yet. In its current form, the algorithm is very limited. You may have noticed the problems by now:

- It doesn't work for negative slopes
- It needs the line to be drawn left to right, otherwise it won't work
- It can't deal with slopes greater than 1 (more vertical lines)

We can make it do all those things by handling the case with negative error, swapping the points around if they're in the wrong order and adding a variant for large slopes.

<Callout emoji="🌶️">
  **Code challenge:** try to extend Bresenham's algorithm with all those things so that it can handle every case. Hint: be careful with vertical lines!
</Callout>

Instead, we're going to use a different solution: a generalized version of Bresenham's algorithm that works with any two points.

<CodeBlock>
```typescript
...

const dx = Math.abs(x1 - x0);
const sx = Math.sign(x1 - x0);
const dy = -Math.abs(y1 - y0);
const sy = Math.sign(y1 - y0);
let error = dx + dy;

let x = x0;
let y = y0;
for (;;) { // Loop until break
  this.surface.setPixel(x, y, { r, g, b, a });
  if (x === x1 && y === y1) break;

  const e2 = 2 * error;
  if (e2 >= dy) {
    if (x0 === x1) break;
    error += dy;
    x += sx;
  }
  if (e2 <= dx) {
    if (y0 === y1) break;
    error += dx;
    y += sy;
  }
}
```
</CodeBlock>

This version does away with iterating over a "master" axis, and instead calculates error over both axes. The code can look a bit confusing, but it's actually rather simple:

- Distance over the `y` axis is inverted. `error` starts off as the sum of the `x` and (inverted) `y` distance to cover.
- In every iteration, we calculate the double of the error (`e2`). This is the same as dividing the other side of the equation by two, but multiplication is faster than division.
  - If it's *greater than or equal to* `dy` (remember it's inverted, so this means it's closer to 0) we're close enough to the line on `y`, so we advance on the `x` axis.
  - If it's *less than or equal to* `dx` it means we're close on `x`, so we advance on `y`.
  - Notice how error can never be both less than `dy` (a negative number) and greater than `dx` (a positive number), so we'll always move one pixel towards the end point in at least one of the two directions.
  
Let's try it out. We'll write some code in our `render()` function to draw lines in every direction by rotating them over time. The function can take an `elapsed` parameter, which indicates the number of milliseconds passed since the first frame, so let's use that:

<CodeBlock title="renderer.ts">
```typescript
public render(elapsed: number) {
  const {width, height} = this.options;
  const angle = elapsed / 1000;
  const middle = { x: width / 2, y: height / 2 };
  const end = {
    x: Math.cos(angle) * 200 + middle.x,
    y: Math.sin(angle) * 200 + middle.y,
  };

  this.drawLine(middle, end, { r: 1, g: 1, b: 1 });
}
```

<div slot="result">
  <video autoplay muted loop src="/img/02-lines/line-spinning.webm" />
</div>
</CodeBlock>

And that's it! It took some work, but we can now draw lines between any two points in our canvas.

In the next lesson, we'll use the line drawing function for something a little more exciting: we'll be drawing our first three-dimensional objects.
